#### #snitch
We will check the timeline of who you ratted out. If one of their last 20 tweets is in all caps, we will bust them and you get a point. More points mean more perks!

#### "the safeword"
Few know what it is. Those that speak it will never be caught again. They also lose access to every command and forfeit any points. Believe it or not, you don't want that to happen. *(the safeword was banana)*
