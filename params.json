Last time was 3 hours ago. You have 4 snitch points.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### #rapsheet\r\nView the #stats of another user that you mention.\r\n\r\n#### #snitch\r\nWe will check the timeline of who you ratted out. If one of their last 20 tweets is in all caps, we will bust them and you get a point. More points mean more perks!\r\n\r\n#### \"the safeword\"\r\nFew know what it is. Those that speak it will never be caught again. They also lose access to every command and forfeit any points. Believe it or not, you don't want that to happen.\r\n\r\n### @CapsCop in the media\r\n\r\n* Australian radio show [Triple J](http://bit.ly/c9Iyrp)\r\n* New York Times [On the Twitter Patrol](http://nyti.ms/avmifi)\r\n* Washington Post [On Twitter, it's caps-lock and load](http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-09/lifestyle/35721890_1_tweet-bots-grammar)\r\n* As seen on  [Encyclopedia Dramatica](https://encyclopediadramatica.se/@CapsCop)\r\n","google":"UA-1091244-24","note":"Don't delete this file!
